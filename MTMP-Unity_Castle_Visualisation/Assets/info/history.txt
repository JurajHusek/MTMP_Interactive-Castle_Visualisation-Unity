Legend of King Sigismund of Luxembourg

According to an old legend, King Sigismund of Luxembourg fell seriously ill in 1404 during a military campaign in Moravia. He suffered from high fevers, which were believed to have developed after staying in the marshy areas near Hodonín, where a dangerous disease had spread. In a critical condition, he was brought to Korlátko Castle, where he was treated by local healers. They were said to use healing water from springs in the vicinity of the castle and unusual medical practices. According to records by Sigismund’s biographer Eberhard Windeck, the king was even hung upside down for a period of time so that the “poison could flow out of him.” Sigismund eventually recovered from the illness, and legend says that Korlátko Castle saved his life.

Legend of the Hidden Treasure

Korlátko Castle is also associated with a legend about a hidden treasure. It was supposedly concealed in underground spaces of the castle or in its immediate surroundings during the turbulent times of the Hussite wars and Turkish raids. The treasure is said to be guarded by supernatural forces and appears only at exceptional moments, especially on St. John’s Night or on Holy Saturday. Anyone who tried to obtain it without pure intentions was allegedly punished by wandering lost in the forests, the sudden disappearance of the treasure, or terrifying apparitions. To this day, it is said that the treasure awaits someone who will seek it not for wealth, but for the good of others.

Korlátko Castle and Estate – A Brief History

Korlátko Castle (also known as Cerová Castle) was built as a watch and guard castle, as clearly indicated by its strategic location on the ridge of the Little Carpathians at an altitude of 455 meters above sea level. Later, it became the center of the Korlátko estate and for a long time served as the residence of its owners, significantly influencing the lives of the surrounding villages.

The most distinctive architectural feature of the castle is the remnant of a cylindrical tower, which is unique in Slovakia. Remains of the palace, fortification walls, and a relatively well-preserved economic building in the outer bailey have also survived. The upper castle with its Gothic core was enclosed by a small courtyard. In the mid-15th century, it was expanded by a larger outer bailey. The fortifications were further strengthened in the second half of the 16th century. The castle remained inhabited until the mid-18th century, when only pandurs guarding prisoners stayed there. After the end of the anti-Turkish wars and the estates’ uprisings, it definitively lost its defensive function.

In written sources from the 13th century onward, the castle appears under various names, such as Korlathkeu, Korlathkew, Kunratstein, Korlatkö, Karlátko, or Cerová Castle. The oldest known map record dates from 1552 (by Wolfgang Lazius), where it is marked as KORLATKW.

According to some historians, the origins of the castle may reach as far back as the year 1041, when the foundations of an earth-and-timber fortification were allegedly built. This hypothesis is connected with the castle’s location in the so-called confinium, a border defense zone of the Kingdom of Hungary. The very name “korlát” in Hungarian means a barrier or boundary. The castle guarded borders as well as important trade routes leading through the Záhorie region since antiquity.

However, historiography clearly links the construction of the stone castle to the second half of the 13th century, the period following the Tatar invasion of 1241, when stone castles began to be systematically built in Hungary. The probable owners were the Abov family, an important Hungarian noble lineage. An unverified mention from 1289 refers to the castle under the name Konrad.

At the end of the 13th century, the castle became royal property and, together with Ostrý Kameň Castle, guarded the important “Czech Road.” A charter issued on January 6, 1336 by King Charles Robert documents the collection of tolls near the castle.

At the beginning of the 14th century, the castle was controlled by Matthew Csák of Trenčín. After conflicts with King Charles Robert, the castle was repaired in 1315 and definitively conquered by royal troops around 1317. Around this time, the settlement of Rozbehy was established.

In the 14th and 15th centuries, the castle was visited by rulers Louis I the Great and Queen Mary. In 1385 it was occupied by Prokop of Moravia, in 1390 it was taken over by Sigismund of Luxembourg, who in 1394 granted it to Stibor of Stiborice. After the death of his son in 1434, the castle returned to the crown.

Between 1440 and 1446, the castle was held by Hussite commanders and robber knights (Ján of Mesenpek and Ján of Moravany, known as Janda). In 1446 it became the residence of Osvald I of Bučany, the founder of the Korlátsky family. In 1473, King Matthias Corvinus confiscated the castle due to the raiding activities of Osvald’s son Michal, but in 1498 it was returned to Osvald the Younger.

After the Battle of Mohács in 1526, where Peter Korlátsky was killed, the castle passed to relatives and was gradually divided among several noble families, including the Pongrác, Apponyi, Dersfi, and others. In the second half of the 16th century and in the 17th century, it belonged mainly to the Apponyi and Pongrác families.

Around 1700, Ján Labšiansky–Korlátsky became the majority owner. He was the last to reside at and repair the castle. After his death in 1740, the castle served only as a prison and subsequently fell into decay.

In 1846, the Motešický family sold their share to Prince Alfred von Windisch-Grätz. After the establishment of Czechoslovakia, most of the estate was divided during land reform. The castle deteriorated further and was nationalized after World War II.

On September 14, 1963, Korlátko Castle was declared a cultural monument, with the symbolic year of its demise set as 1740.

The history of the castle is closely connected with major historical events, including the Tatar invasion (1241), Hussite campaigns, Turkish raids (especially in 1663), estates’ uprisings (Bethlen, Thököly, Rákóczi), and the revolutionary years of 1848–1849. The castle is also linked to legends about outlaws and healing water, which was said to have cured King Sigismund of Luxembourg in 1404.
